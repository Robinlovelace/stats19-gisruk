# Plan (to be removed)

- Talk from ~10:30, 15 minutes and 5 minutes for questions


- History of crash research
- Geographic research
- Lack of reproducibility, time wasted cleaning data
- Data is inaccessible to public
- What stats19 can do for you (live demo?)
- Analyst use case
- Dashboard potential
- Interactive map interface (Layik)

# History of crash research




---

# Geographic analyses of crashes


---

# (Lack of) reproducibility in road safety research

- Takes days to figure out STATS19 .csv files 
- Huge amount of time spent by researchers on data cleaning
- This is an error prone process

# (In)accessibility
