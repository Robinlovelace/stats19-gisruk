# Introduction

- Roads kill more young, healthy people than any other cause of death

Kills more people than war.

Inherently geographical.

Why isn't it a major branch of GIS research? Lack of data!

# History of crash research

# Geographic analyses of crashes

# (Lack of) reproducibility in road safety research

- Takes days to figure out STATS19 .csv files 
- Huge amount of time spent by researchers on data cleaning
- This is an error prone process

# (In)accessibility
